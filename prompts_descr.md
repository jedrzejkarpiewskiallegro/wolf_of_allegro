# Copilot Strategy Prompts

- gh_copilot_minimalist: Minimal bids, spends only when needed; slight aggression bump if many opponents want the item.
- gh_copilot_adaptive: Phase-based (early/mid/late), adjusts for quality, scarcity, and budget strength; smart increments to avoid ties.
- gh_copilot_opportunistic: Exploits strength and scarcity; nudges 3–6% above minimum to edge out ties when rich or items are rare.
- gh_copilot_lockdown: Disciplined budget bands with late-game push; strong scarcity override and small pulse raises for tie-breaks.
- gh_copilot_sparse_guard: Scarcity-first; multiplies budget hard when copies are nearly gone, stays cheap when supply is ample.
- gh_copilot_counter_flow: Reacts to how many opponents need the item; blends pressure, scarcity, and quality for dynamic caps.
- gh_copilot_budget_sentry: Strict per-item allowance; breaks ceiling only on last/second-to-last copies, with gentle tie bumps.
